# SendNotes - TALL Stack

SendNotes is a simple web application developed with the **TALL Stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel and Livewire)**, allowing create notes and share them by email. The application uses Laravel for the backend, Livewire for dynamic updates, Tailwind CSS for responsive design and Alpine.js for interactivity on the client. It also uses Blade, Laravel's templating engine, to create efficient and reusable views. SendNotes is hosted on Fly.io, which offers a scalable and efficient infrastructure for web applications.
